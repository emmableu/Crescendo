# Crescendo's installment is similar to lambda (https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2018/EECS-2018-2.html). Below is the introduction by Michael Ball on how to install lambda

# λ : lambda
Lambda is an LTI app for autograding [Snap<em>!</em>][1] programs.

λ maintains a database of questions and submissions, and will allow students to
log in through LTI - which means that their scores can be saved to whatever
LMS you're course is using, like Canvas or edX.

## Overview

We have:
* questions
* Submissions
* Users
* AG-Interfaces

## LTI Overview

### Running in Development
If you're developing against a public LMS, like a hosted edX course or Canvas
instance, then you'll need ngrok or another tool to expose your dev environment
to the internet. 

The ngrok configuration is mostly setup, but you'll need an API key. Once that
is set, you can use `./launch-lti` to get it running.

### Configurations
LTI Config TODO.

* Launch URL: `https://lambda.cs10.org/lti/sessions`
* Key and Secret: Currently stored on the server :O
* Use `?question_id=X` after the launch URL to load a specific question.

### Custom Parameters
None Yet...
### edX

* Follow edX guide. TODO: get link.

### Canvas (bCourses)
**Note about submitting grades:** Canvas requires you to be in "Student View" for the LTI tool to be able to passback a grade. Get to this through your course's settings.

* Pass the tool 'public' information

## Cloning
Clone with `git clone --recursive` to download the snap source as a submodule.

If you've already cloned without `--recursive` do:

* `git submodule init`
* `git submodule update`

## Development Getting Started
Once things are setup, use `./run` to launch Rails and start ngrok.

After you have cloned this repo, run this setup script to set up your machine
with the necessary dependencies to run and test this app:

    % ./bin/setup

It assumes you have a machine equipped with Ruby, Postgres, etc. If not, set up
your machine with `brew` (on a Mac).

---


## Requirements and Setup
* Ruby version
	* 2.3.3
* System dependencies
	* Postgres, qt, ngrok
	* `brew install postgres qt`
	* OSX Install postgres:
	```sh
	# To have launchd start postgresql at login:
	ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/postgresql/*plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents

	# Then to load postgresql now:
	launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist
	```
	* `ngrok` 2 Mac binary is in `bin/`
		* Currently the run script uses `ngrok.yml` with a custom domain.
		* If you don't want to pay, just edit this file.
* Configuration
* Database creation
	* Postgres needs to be running!
	* `rake db:create`
	* `rake db:migrate`
* Database initialization
	* TODO create seeds file
* How to run the test suite
* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)
* Deployment instructions
